# Single Page App Seed

A very opinionated seed for creating Single Page Apps that uses NO framework at all. Just a bunch of [component libs](#used-libraries).

## Why?

You want to **create a new SPA but you don't want to depend on any framework** like AngularJS or Ember. You just want to roll your own thing. For that, you can start with this seed.

## Used libraries

### Build Libraries
* Browserify
* Rework
* Gulpfile
* Watchify

### App libraries
* RippleJS
* Page.js
* Bootstrap

## Prerequisites

Have gulp installed globally: `npm install -g gulp`

## Using it

Just run `npm install`, run `gulp` and then go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Feedback

Do you have any feedback about the app? Just let us know :)
